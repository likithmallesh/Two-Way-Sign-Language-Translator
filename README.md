# ✋🔄 Two Way Sign Language Translator  

A **desktop application** that enables seamless communication by translating **voice to sign language** and **sign language to voice**.  
This project aims to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community and others.

## ⚙️ Libraries & Tools  
- **Tkinter** – GUI framework  
- **TensorFlow & Keras** – Deep learning models  
- **PyAudio & SpeechRecognition** – Voice input & processing  
- **PIL (Pillow)** – Image handling  
- **OpenCV** – Video & gesture recognition

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras pyaudio SpeechRecognition pillow opencv-python
Run the main GUI application:

bash
Copy code
python3 main.py
To add new GIFs (sign animations) to the dataset:

Place files directly into the dataset folder with appropriate filenames

Or use extract.py with file paths for automated extraction

🎯 Features
🎤 Voice to Sign Translation – Converts spoken words into sign language GIFs.

🖐️ Sign to Voice Translation – Uses gesture recognition to translate signs into text/voice.

🖼️ Customizable Dataset – Add new signs easily with GIFs or images.

🖥️ User-Friendly GUI – Built with Tkinter for a smooth experience.

✅ Summary
This project demonstrates how AI + Computer Vision + Speech Recognition can work together to make communication more inclusive.
